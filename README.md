# Hello Everyone!

My name is **Riza Nursyah**.

I am a **Informatics Engineering Student** at [Muhammadiyah University of Sukabumi](https://ummi.ac.id/).

I'm currently taking semester 5 and part of Bangkit Academy 2023 on the Machine Learning Path, before joining Bangkit Academy I learned a little about machine learning on coursera [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/ZDU7EP78CA5J?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=course).

I also made a data analysis with title [Preprocessing Data, Analysis, and Regression Modeling on The Daily Update of Covid-19 in Jakarta](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KhZYYEaX5yK_9BgPlshpL8gJINwsPrhO).
